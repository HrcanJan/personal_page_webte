					<div class="tooltip"><h2>Leonard Hofstadter</h2>
						<img class="imgt" src="img/Leonard.jpg" alt="Leonard" width="50%">
						<p>Dr. Leonard Leakey Hofstadter, Ph.D., is an experimental physicist at the California Institute of 
						Technology who formerly roomed with Sheldon Cooper in Apartment 4A and now he and his wife Penny live in that 
						apartment and they also formerly lived in Penny's apartment Apartment 4B. Along with Sheldon, he is one of the 
						main male protagonists of The Big Bang Theory. Originally from New Jersey, Leonard attended Princeton University 
						and was twenty-four years old when he received his doctorate with a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental 
						particle physics</p></div>

					<div class="tooltipleft"><h2>Sheldon Cooper</h2>
					<img class="imgt" src="img/Sheldon.png" alt="Sheldon" width="50%">
					<p>Dr. Sheldon Lee Cooper, B.Sc., M.Sc., M.A., Ph.D., Sc.D., is a Caltech theoretical physicist. 
						Next to his best friend Leonard Hofstadter, he's the main protagonist of The Big Bang Theory. Originally 
						from East Texas, Sheldon started college at the age of 11, receiving his first Ph.D. at the age of 16. 
						As a kid, Sheldon was involved in numerous experiments as a "wunderkind", such as his plan to provide free 
						electricity for his hometown by building a nuclear reactor - a plan stopped by government pen pushers 
						claiming it's illegal to store yellowcake uranium in a garden shed. Proudly geeky, he has no qualms about 
						speaking Klingon, wearing vintage t-shirts sporting superhero logos, or spouting various historical and 
						cultural anecdotes. While he might claim to be the perfect human specimen, Sheldon does have his faults. 
						Sheldon is characterized by a strict adherence to routine and hygiene; an overly intellectual personality; 
						a tenuous understanding of irony, sarcasm and humor; and a general lack of humility or empathy, the former 
						of which is demonstrated in the fact that he has no problem voicing to his peers his admiration for his 
						superior intellect.</p>

					<div class="tooltip"><h2>Penny Teller</h2>
						<img class="imgt" src="img/Penny.jpg" alt="Penny" width="50%">
						<p>Penny Teller is a fictional character on the American CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory. She is the primary female 
						character in the series. She lives in Apartment 4A with her husband Leonard Hofstadter across the hall from 
						Sheldon Cooper and Amy Farrah Fowler who live in apartment 4B where Penny used to live. An aspiring, but 
						mostly unsuccessful actress, she was born on a farm near Omaha, Nebraska, and worked at The Cheesecake Factory 
						as a waitress until she quit in to take up acting full-time.</p>

					<div class="tooltip"><h2>Rajesh Koothrappali</h2>
						<img class="imgt" src="img/Raj.png" alt="Raj" width="50%">
						<p>Dr. Rajesh Ramayan "Raj" Koothrappali, Ph.D., is an astrophysicist and Howard Wolowitz's best friend. 
							He often hangs out at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, though he has his own apartment (the Raj Mahal) in 
							Pasadena. Originally from New Delhi, Raj has an Indian English accent and, ironically, dislikes Indian food 
							and culture. He frequently portrays himself as having come from humble origins and growing up in poverty 
							in India, only for his friends to remind him that his father is a gynecologist, drives a Bentley, and has 
							a house full of servants. For the first six seasons, his principal characteristic was a case of selective 
							mutism social anxiety disorder, which did not allow him to talk to women outside of his family.</p>

				<div class="marker" id ="howard">
					<div class="tooltip"><h2>Howard Wolowitz</h2>
						<img class="imgt" src="img/Howard.jpg" alt="Howard" width="50%">
						<p>Howard Joel Wolowitz, M.Eng., is a Jewish aerospace engineer and ex-astronaut. He is the son of an 
							overbearing mother, Debbie Wolowitz, who couldn't care less about his scientific accomplishments and 
							still talks to him as if he were a child. As the best friend of Rajesh Koothrappali, Howard often hangs 
							out at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment with him. Although he's the only member of the group lacking a 
							doctoral degree, he defends himself by pointing out that he not only has a master's degree in Engineering 
							from MIT, but also designs important devices like the "space toilet" and telescope used at the 
							International Space Station and components for satellites and space probes. Fancying himself a smooth 
							ladies' man, Howard is rather confident in trying to woo girls (unlike the other three), mostly through 
							creepy overtures and sometimes with his knowledge of foreign languages, of which he knows seven.

				<div class="marker" id ="berni">
					<div class="tooltip"><h2>Bernadette Rostenkowski</h2>
						<img class="imgt" src="img/Berni.jpg" alt="Bernadette" width="50%">
						<p>Dr. Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski, is a former waitress at the Cheesecake Factory and has earned her 
							Ph.D in microbiology who has a lucrative job at the pharmaceutical company ZanGen. She began dating Howard 
							Wolowitz in "The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary" and eventually married him in "The Countdown Reflection", 
							Season 5 finale. She had her own apartment in Pasadena which Howard eventually moved into finally leaving 
							Debbie Wolowitz's house. In Season 7, they start thinking about raising a family after Debbie has to 
							convalesce.</p>

				<div class="marker" id ="amy">
					<div class="tooltipleft"><h2>Amy Farrah Fowler</h2>
						<img class="imgt" src="img/amy.jpg" alt="Amy" width="50%">
						<p>Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, Ph.D., is a neurobiologist.
							Amy is from Glendale, California. She also has a doctorate degree in neurobiology from Harvard University, i
							nspired by actor Mayim Bialik's own doctorate.
							She initially was discovered by Raj and Howard as a possible match for Sheldon through an online dating 
							service. By Sheldon's own admission, she is most like him by any standard. Like him, she has previously 
							avoided relationships (whether romantic or otherwise is entirely unclear). She has her own apartment. 
							She also has a five-year plan to become Mrs. Cooper.</p>
